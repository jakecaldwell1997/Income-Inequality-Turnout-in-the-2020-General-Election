# **Income Inequality & Turnout**

##### Introduction

Income inequality is   

##### Formative Literature 



##### This Project  

The following is an exploratory attempt to unravel the relationship between rising income inequality and voter turnout in the 2020 General Election.  I explore the relationship between the two from the broadest level of analysis to the most narrow available to me:  

- I begin with state-level analysis with a simple bi-variate regression between the variables of interest.  

- From there, I do the same at the county level with a rough estimate of county-level turnout rates.  

- The final and primary analysis is an in-depth look at North Carolina using data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections.
