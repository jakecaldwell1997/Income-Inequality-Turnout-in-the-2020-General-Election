# **Income Inequality & Turnout in 2020 General Election**

##### Introduction: The Question

Since the 1980s, inequality has risen in the United States, reaching heights not seen previously since the Gilded Age.  At the same time, certain political science research has found evidence suggesting economic and political equality coincide. Thus, I investigate whether greater income inequality influences voters' propensity to vote or not. 

##### Formative Literature 
- Gilens and Page (2014)
  - Notes that when rich & poor disagree on policy, the rich overwhelmingly "win" these disputes

- McDonald (2014)
  - Notes competing explanations of the turnout-inequality relationship look at different levels of aggregation
    - Trust Model: State-level
    - Conflict: County-level
    


##### This Project  

The following is an exploratory first step in unraveling the relationship between rising income inequality and voter turnout in the 2020 General Election.  I explore the relationship between the two from the broadest level of analysis to the most narrow:  

- I begin with state-level analysis with a simple bi-variate regression between the variables of interest.  

- From there, I do the same at the county level with a rough estimate of county-level turnout rates.  

- The final and primary analysis is an in-depth look at North Carolina leveraging data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections.
